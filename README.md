# Bike Sharing Dashboard

## About The Project

This project focuses on analyzing data from a bike-sharing system to uncover key insights and trends that can inform decision-making.  The project explor usage patterns in daily, weekday vs weekend usage of bike sharing, the impact of season conditions, and time of day especially the busiest time for bike sharing activity.

1. Data Gathering : to collect the data
2. Data Assesing : to to identify problems in the data and ensure the quality of the data. But the data clean enough so i just change the type data of dteday
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) : to explore data to answer business questions. Where I explore a lot related to the number of users with time.
4. Visualization : make visualization from EDA
5. Time Series Analyst : to more know and more analysis from data
